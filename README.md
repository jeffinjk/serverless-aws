# Serverless Web Application Deployment on AWS

## Overview

This project demonstrates the serverless deployment of a web application using AWS services, showcasing the benefits of serverless architecture, such as cost optimization, scalability, and reduced infrastructure management. 

The application utilizes AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and S3 to provide a fully functional web application capable of data retrieval and storage.

## Project Description

This project provides a comprehensive guide to deploying a serverless web application on AWS. It encompasses the following key components:

- **Data Management**: Using DynamoDB to store and manage application data.
- **Serverless Functions**: Implementing AWS Lambda functions for processing application logic.
- **API Integration**: Creating an API Gateway to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend services.
- **Static Hosting**: Utilizing Amazon S3 for hosting the static files of the web application.
- **Security**: Enhancing security with AWS CloudFront for secure access to the S3 bucket.

## Technologies Used

- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute service to run code in response to events.
- **Amazon S3**: Object storage service for hosting static websites.
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: NoSQL database service for data management.
- **Amazon API Gateway**: Service to create and manage APIs for connecting applications to backend services.
- **Amazon CloudFront**: Content delivery network for distributing content securely and efficiently.

## Deployment Steps

### Part 1: Setting Up the Environment

1. **Create a DynamoDB Table**:
   - Navigate to the DynamoDB service in the AWS Management Console.
   - Create a new table with the required attributes and primary key settings.

2. **Create Lambda Functions**:
   - Go to the Lambda service and create a new function for data retrieval.
   - Implement the necessary logic to interact with DynamoDB (for example, using the AWS SDK).

### Part 2: Creating an API with Lambda Functions

1. **Set Up API Gateway**:
   - Open the API Gateway service and create a new API.
   - Define resources and methods (GET, POST) that trigger the Lambda functions created earlier.

2. **Deploy the API**:
   - Deploy the API to a new or existing stage to make it accessible via an endpoint.

### Part 3: Integrating DynamoDB for Data Management

1. **Connect Lambda Functions to DynamoDB**:
   - Modify the Lambda functions to include logic for inserting and retrieving data from the DynamoDB table.

2. **Save and Verify Data**:
   - Implement test cases or manual tests to verify that the data is being saved and retrieved correctly.

### Part 4: Hosting the Application on S3

1. **Upload Files to S3**:
   - Create an S3 bucket and upload the static files of your web application (HTML, CSS, JS).

2. **Enable Static Web Hosting**:
   - Go to the bucket properties and enable static website hosting, specifying the index and error document.

3. **Set Permissions**:
   - Configure bucket policies to allow public read access to the files.

### Part 5: Security Enhancements with CloudFront

1. **Set Up CloudFront Distribution**:
   - Create a CloudFront distribution that points to your S3 bucket for secure access.

2. **Secure S3 Bucket Access**:
   - Adjust the bucket policy to restrict direct access to the S3 bucket, allowing access only through CloudFront.

## Testing the Application

After deployment, test the application by accessing the API endpoints and verifying that data can be inserted and retrieved from the DynamoDB table. Ensure that the web application is accessible through the CloudFront URL.

## Next Steps

1. **Explore Additional Features**: Consider implementing features like user authentication, form validations, or real-time data updates.
2. **Optimize for Performance**: Monitor performance metrics and optimize for cost and efficiency.
