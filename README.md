# Serverless Web Application Deployment on AWS

## Overview

This project demonstrates the serverless deployment of a web application using AWS services, highlighting the benefits of serverless architecture, such as cost optimization, scalability, and reduced infrastructure management. 

The tutorial is structured in multiple segments, each focusing on key aspects of the deployment process, from setting up the necessary AWS services to testing and verifying the functionality of the application.

## Project Description

This video tutorial series provides a step-by-step guide for deploying a serverless web application on AWS. Each section focuses on specific tasks:

- **Part 1**: Demonstrates the basics of serverless architecture and cost optimization.
- **Part 2**: Covers the creation of an API to trigger a Lambda function and the hosting of the application using S3 static web hosting.
- **Part 3**: Discusses creating and configuring a DynamoDB table and Lambda functions for data retrieval and insertion.
- **Part 4**: Focuses on uploading files to S3, enabling static web hosting, and configuring permissions for accessibility.
- **Part 5**: Highlights security enhancements using CloudFront to secure S3 bucket access.

## Technologies Used

- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute service to run code in response to events.
- **Amazon S3**: Object storage service for hosting static websites.
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: NoSQL database service for data management.
- **Amazon API Gateway**: Service to create and manage APIs for connecting applications to backend services.
- **Amazon CloudFront**: Content delivery network for distributing content securely and efficiently.

## Deployment Steps

### Part 1: Setting Up the Environment

1. **Create a DynamoDB Table**: Set up a table with the necessary attributes.
2. **Create Lambda Functions**: Set up Lambda functions to handle data retrieval and insertion into the DynamoDB table.

### Part 2: Creating an API with Lambda Functions

1. **Set Up API Gateway**: Create an API that triggers the Lambda function.
2. **Configure API Methods**: Define the GET and POST methods for data retrieval and insertion.

### Part 3: Integrating DynamoDB for Data Management

1. **Connect Lambda Functions to DynamoDB**: Ensure the Lambda functions can interact with the DynamoDB table.
2. **Save and Verify Student Data**: Implement logic to store and retrieve data in the DynamoDB table.

### Part 4: Hosting the Application on S3

1. **Upload Files to S3**: Upload the static files of the web application to an S3 bucket.
2. **Enable Static Web Hosting**: Configure the S3 bucket to serve the web application as a static website.
3. **Set Permissions**: Configure bucket policies to allow public access to the files.

### Part 5: Security Enhancements with CloudFront

1. **Set Up CloudFront Distribution**: Configure a CloudFront distribution to serve the content from the S3 bucket securely.
2. **Secure S3 Bucket Access**: Implement security measures to restrict direct access to the S3 bucket.

## Testing the Application

Once deployed, test the application by accessing the API endpoints and verifying that data is correctly inserted and retrieved from the DynamoDB table. Also, ensure that the web application is accessible through the CloudFront URL.

## Next Steps

1. **Explore Additional Features**: Consider adding features like user authentication, more advanced data handling, or integration with other AWS services.
2. **Optimize for Performance**: Monitor the application performance and make necessary adjustments for cost and efficiency.
